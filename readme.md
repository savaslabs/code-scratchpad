# Savas Code Scratchpad

This repo is a basic way to prototype or start a project quickly.

## Requirements
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Node Package Manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) 


## What's in here?
- This uses [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev) as an app bundler.
- Allows styling with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and/or [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) (whichever you prefer, see `/src/css/index.css` for details)
- Does _not_ contain any javascript framework, add your own if you like.

## To get started

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

3. Run Snowpack:

```sh
npm run start
```

The project will open in the browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

You will know everything works because it will load a pink page with centered text as well as some basic logs in the console that show the text on the page.
